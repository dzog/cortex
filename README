Cortex creates graphics based off of Kuver's form constants.  The original paper documenting the mathematics can be found at the following URL:

This program has been tested on Ubuntu 12.04 and OSX 10.8

Patterns can be activated and deactivated using the numeric keys:

1 - Vertical Bands
2 - Horizontal Bands
3 - Diagonal Bands
4 - Arms
5 - Rings
6 - Spirals

the subsequent row of letters (q,w,e,r,t,y) increase the speed of each pattern; the corresponding capital letters (Q,W,E,R,T,Y) decrease the speed by the same amount.

The next row of letters (a,s,d,f,g,h) increases the frequency of the input sinusoid, changing the numbers of bands / rings / arms that appear in the pattern.  The respective capital letter decreases the parameter.
